g. What is the main branch?
Main or master is default branch when you create a repository. GitHub now use main as it's default branch.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
If you make changes directly in the main branch without creating a separate branch, you risk overwriting other developers' changes, losing your work, or introducing bugs in your code. This can cause delays in your development process, and it can be frustrating for your team members.
